This maps the <F7> key to an xml tag inserter. When you press <F7> while to cursor is on or directly after a word, the that word is transformed into an xml tag, complete with closing tag. When the cusor is not over a word, you will be prompted for a tag name. This works in insert and comment mode.

This plugin depends on the imaps plugin that comes with the vim latex-suite (vim-latex) or can be downloaded separately at http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=244
